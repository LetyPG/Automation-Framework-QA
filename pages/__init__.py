- The __init__.py file can be left empty or it can contain initialization code for the package.
- This is also need as a Python convention to make the directory a package as an independent module, that can provide that 
the class and methods included on each independent file inside of this directed can be used in other files of the project as an 'import' utility

pytest to run the tests in each directory,
